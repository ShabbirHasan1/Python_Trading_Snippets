    "# Event-driven backtesting\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: https://www.fmz.com/bbs-topic/3600\n",
    "\n",
    "The vectorised nature of pandas ensures that certain operations on large datasets are extremely rapid. However the forms of vectorised backtester suffer from some drawbacks in the way that trade execution is simulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In event-driven software the entire set of calculations is run within an \"infinite\" loop known as the event-loop or game-loop. The code is continually checking for new events and then performing actions based on these events. In particular it allows the illusion of real-time response handling because the code is continually being looped and events checked for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Event-driven systems (EDS):\n",
    " - Advantages over simpler vectorised systems: \n",
    "     - Code Reuse (can be used for both historical backtesting and live trading with minimal switch-out of components). This is not true of vectorised backtesters where all data must be available at once to carry out statistical analysis.\n",
    "     - Lookahead Bias - With an event-driven backtester there is no lookahead bias as market data receipt is treated as an \"event\" that must be acted upon. \n",
    "     - Realism - Event-driven backtesters allow significant customisation over how orders are executed and transaction costs are incurred. It is straightforward to handle basic market and limit orders, as well as market-on-open (MOO) and market-on-close (MOC), since a custom exchange handler can be constructed.\n",
    " - Disadvantages over simpler vectorised systems:\n",
    "    - more complex to implement and test. There are more \"moving parts\" leading to a greater chance of introducing bugs. To mitigate this proper software testing methodology such as test-driven development can be employed.\n",
    "    - slower to execute compared to a vectorised system. "

    "All below components are wrapped in an event-loop. Components (or objects) EDS:\n",
    "    - Event: contains a type (such as \"MARKET\", \"SIGNAL\", \"ORDER\" or \"FILL\") that determines how it will be handled within the event-loop.\n",
    "    - Event Queue: in-memory Python Queue object that stores all of the Event sub-class objects that are generated by the rest of the software.\n",
    "    - DataHandler: abstract base class (ABC) that presents an interface for handling both historical or live market data => Strategy and Portfolio modules can thus be reused between both approaches. The DataHandler generates a new MarketEvent upon every heartbeat of the system (see below).\n",
    "    - Strategy: this ABC takes market data and generates SignalEvents, which are ultimately utilised by the Portfolio object. A SignalEvent contains a ticker symbol, a direction (LONG or SHORT) and a timestamp.\n",
    "    - Portfolio: this ABC handles the order mgmt associated with current and subsequent positions for a strategy. It also carries out risk management across the portfolio, including sector exposure and position sizing. In a more sophisticated implementation this could be delegated to a RiskManagement class. The Portfolio takes SignalEvents from the Queue and generates OrderEvents that get added to the Queue.\n",
    "    - ExecutionHandler: simulates a connection to a brokerage. Takes OrderEvents from the Queue and execute them, either via a simulated approach or an actual connection to a liver brokerage. Once orders are executed the handler creates FillEvents, which describe what was actually transacted, including fees, commission and slippage (if modelled)."
